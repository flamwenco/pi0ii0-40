## Production files

The current version of this pcb that supports all above layouts has been ordered and confirmed to work, but I am not responsible for your orders with a pcb manu. No support will be provided, order at your own risk.

## Special Thanks
[SST60](https://github.com/dededecline/SST60), this project heavily lifts the rp2040 wiring from it
